  abstract  = "[This paper examines residential mobility of prehistoric Jomon
               hunter-gatherers in Japan. Despite the common assumption of
               Jomon people as fully sedentary, living in permanent residential
               bases year-round, Jomon settlement systems are in fact poorly
               understood. In this paper, intersite variability in lithic
               assemblages and site size are used to interpret Early Jomon
               Moroiso phase subsistence-settlement systems. The results of the
               analysis indicate that, while the Moroiso phase people were
               relatively sedentary, they did not necessarily remain in the
               same settlement throughout the year. These results are then used
               to address the question of the development of sedentism and
               cultural complexity through the Jomon Period.]",

 abstract="The use of computers and complex software is pervasive in archaeology, yet their role in the analytical pipeline is rarely exposed for other researchers to inspect or reuse. This limits the progress of archaeology because researchers cannot easily reproduce each other's work to verify or extend it. Four general principles of reproducible research that have emerged in other fields are presented. An archaeological case study is described that shows how each principle can be implemented using freely available software. The costs and benefits of implementing reproducible research are assessed. The primary benefit, of sharing data in particular, is increased impact via an increased number of citations. The primary cost is the additional time required to enhance reproducibility, although the exact amount is difficult to quantify.",
